# Random Movie

## Description
The Random Movie project is a simple application for randomly selecting a movie from a list that is stored in an XML file strings.xml . The user can click on the button, and a randomly selected movie from the last one will be displayed in the text field of the application. If there are no more movies, the app will notify you about it. There is also a Reset button to start showing movies from the beginning.
