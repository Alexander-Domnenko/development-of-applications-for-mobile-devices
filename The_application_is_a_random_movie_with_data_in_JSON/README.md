# Random Movie 2.0

## Description
The Random Movie 2.0 project is an updated application for randomly selecting a movie from a suggested list. Unlike the previous version, information about movies is now stored in a JSON file, which is located in the application resources. Each film contains not only the title, but also additional information such as the year of release, director, genre, rating and cast list.
